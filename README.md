# Project to gain exposure to api's, ai, material -ui

This project was created to get me comfortable using api's to fetch data.
I also explored the Alan app/ai.

# Resources

I followed a youtube video to understand the project. I choose this video in particular because it incorporated using apis, material -ui for styling, react hooks, and the alan ai.

here is the link if you would like to code along.
